9.Out of the stripping options available for the EBS volumes,which one has the following disadvantage :
'Doubles the amount of 1/0 required from the instance to EBS compared to RAID 0,bec.ause you're mirroring all writes to a pair of volumes,limiting how much you can stripe.' ?

A  Raid 0
B. RAID 1+0 (RAID 10)
C. Raid 1
D. Raid

ANS:C

Explanation:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2Jlatest/WindowsGuide/raid-config .html
raid 0 and 1 are the common types . Raid 5 and 6 are not recommended because of the extended stripe . If you encounter this question on the exam Isuspect the answer options will be different.
Raid 1 Disadvantage
Does not provide a write performance improvement;requires more Amazon EC2 to Amazon EBS bandwidth than non-RAID configurations because the data is written to multiple volumes simultaneously.
Raid 0 Disadvantage
Performance of the stripe is limited to the worst performing volume in the set. Loss of a single volume results in a complete data loss for the array. Raid 5 and 6 notes
RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes . Depending on the configuration of your RAID array,these RAID modes provide 20-30% fewer usable IOPS than a RAID 0 configuration. Increased cost is a factor with these RAID modes as well;when using identicalvolume sizes and speeds,a 2-volume RAID 0 array can outperform a 4-volume RAID 6 array that costs twice as much.
